# V-JS-Interop Example

A simple example demonstrating interaction between JS and V.
It uses a single-file structure where the `index.html` file contains the UI code, which is connected
to the `main.v` V application.

Refer to the sibling example, `project-structure`, which organizes this example into a project
structure that can serve as a starting guide for more complex Webview projects.
